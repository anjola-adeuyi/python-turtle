# Python Turtle Graphics

This project is an example of using Python Turtle Graphics to create colorful patterns which i experimented on.

## Getting Started

To run the program, you need to have Python and the turtle library installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install the turtle library by running the following command in the terminal:

      pip install turtle

Once you have Python and the turtle library installed, you can run the program by opening a terminal, navigating to the directory where the `file.py` file is located, and running the following command:

      python file.py


## Usage

The program uses Python Turtle Graphics to create colorful patterns on a black background. The hue of the colors changes gradually as the pattern is drawn, creating a mesmerizing effect.

You can modify the program to create different patterns by changing the values of the `hue`, `speed`, and `tracer` variables. You can also change the color of the pen by modifying the `pencolor` variable.
